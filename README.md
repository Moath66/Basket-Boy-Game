# Basket Boy Game

## About
**Basket Boy Game** is an interactive C++ game where players take control of a character who shoots basketballs into hoops to score points. With an intuitive score system, engaging animations, and a unique physics engine for realistic ball movement, this project demonstrates advanced proficiency in **object-oriented programming** (OOP) and **game creation**. The game provides an enjoyable experience with responsive controls and dynamic gameplay.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: The main programming language used to develop the game.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Used for designing and managing the game's components, such as the player character, basketball, hoops, and score system.
- **Custom Physics Engine**: A unique physics engine implemented to simulate realistic ball movement, bouncing, and hoop interaction.
- **Graphics/Animation**: Basic graphics and animations to bring the game to life with smooth transitions and visual feedback.

## Features
- **Player Control**: The player can control the character to aim and shoot basketballs into hoops.
- **Score System**: Points are awarded when the player successfully scores a basket, with the score displayed in real-time.
- **Physics Engine**: Realistic ball movement, including bouncing off surfaces and interaction with the hoop, powered by a custom-built physics engine.
- **Captivating Animations**: Dynamic visual feedback that enhances the overall gameplay experience, such as the ball spinning, the hoop reacting, and score changes.
- **User Interface**: Simple and clear UI displaying score and game status.
- **Replayability**: The game encourages repeated play with increasingly challenging hoops and a high score system.
